## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `healthchecksio`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/healthchecksio/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Healthchecks.io"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/healthchecksio/.translations/en.json
custom_components/healthchecksio/__init__.py
custom_components/healthchecksio/binary_sensor.py
custom_components/healthchecksio/config_flow.py
custom_components/healthchecksio/const.py
custom_components/healthchecksio/manifest.json
```

## Configuration

### Site Root

This is the root URL of your Healthchecks.io instance.

### Ping Endpoint

### Check ID

This is the ID of the check that this integration should update, this ID looks something like `aa247c51-8da8-4800-86a3-48763142e902`

This integration will send an update to it every `5` minuttes.

### API Key
